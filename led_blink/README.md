# LED Blink using Arduino Uno

At first I tested by plugging in LED directly into my Arduino Uno, in which case the value of the port would have been : `#define LED 13`

Then I used the grove kit, and plugged on D4 so changed the value to: `#define LED 4`

In this I'm only blinking the LED for 10 times. If you want or more or less, you can edit this line : `int LOOPCOUNT = 10;`
